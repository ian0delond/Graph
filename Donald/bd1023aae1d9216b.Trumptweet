an extended interview from the super bowl with @oreillyfactor airs tonight at 8:00 p.m. enjoy!pic.twitter.com/kzdhqantvr
the failing @nytimes writes total fiction concerning me. they have gotten it wrong for two years, and now are making up stories & sources!
i call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. some fake news media, in order to marginalize, lies!
any negative polls are fake news, just like the cnn, abc, nbc polls in the election. sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.
what an amazing comeback and win by the patriots. tom brady, bob kraft and coach b are total winners. wow!
enjoy the #superbowl and then we continue: make america great again!
i have instructed homeland security to check people coming into our country very carefully. the courts are making the job very difficult!
just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. if something happens blame him and court system. people pouring in. bad!
the judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. bad people are very happy!
interview with @oreillyfactor on fox network - 4:00 p.m. (prior to super bowl). enjoy!
why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. a terrible decision
what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into u.s.?
make america great again!
after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the fake news @nytimes is still lost!
the opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
interesting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban. they know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!
when a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!
countries charge u.s. companies taxes or tariffs while the u.s. charges them nothing or little.we should charge them same as they charge us!
we must keep \"evil\" out of our country!
a new radical islamic terrorist has just attacked in louvre museum in paris. tourists were locked down. france on edge again. get smart u.s.

iran is rapidly taking over more and more of iraq even after the u.s. has squandered three trillion dollars there. obvious long ago!
everybody is arguing whether or not it is a ban. call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!

we had a great news conference at trump tower today. a couple of fake news organizations were there but the people truly get what's going on
intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. one last shot at me.are we living in nazi germany?
i win an election easily, a great \"movement\" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with fake news. a sorry state!
russia has never tried to use leverage over me. i have nothing to do with russia - no deals, no loans, no nothing!
russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \"a complete and total fabrication, utter nonsense.\" very unfair!

nobody should be allowed to burn the american flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
i thought that @cnn would get better after they failed so badly in their support of hillary clinton however, since election, they are worse!
the great state of michigan was just certified as a trump win giving all of our make america great again supporters another victory - 306!
.@cnn is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of hillary clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do.
\"@sdcritic:  @highonhillcrest @jeffzeleny @cnn there is no question that #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #corrupthillary !\"
\"@fiiibuster: @jeffzeleny pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that donald trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame! bad reporter.
\"@joebowman12: @jeffzeleny just another generic cnn part time wannabe journalist !\"  @cnn still doesn't get it. they will never learn!

if cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the cuban people, the cuban/american people and the u.s. as a whole, i will terminate deal.
serious voter fraud in virginia, new hampshire and california - so why isn't the media reporting on this? serious bias - big problem!
states instead of the 15 states that i visited. i would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
it would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in 3 or 4--
in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide, i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally

great meetings will take place today at trump tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.
the failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. i can fully understand that - but why announce?
perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. in the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
i cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. not nice
many people would like to see @nigel_farage represent great britain as their ambassador to the united states. he would do a great job!

numerous patriots will be coming to bedminster today as i continue to fill out the various positions necessary to make america great again!
the cast and producers of hamilton, which i hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to mike pence for their terrible behavior
the theater must always be a safe and special place.the cast of hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, mike pence. apologize!
our wonderful future v.p. mike pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of hamilton, cameras blazing.this should not happen!
the only bad thing about winning the presidency is that i did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on trump u. too bad!
i settled the trump university lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as president i have to focus on our country.

i worked hard with bill ford to keep the lincoln plant in kentucky. i owed it to the great state of kentucky for their confidence in me!

my transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #maga
australia, new zealand, and more. i am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
i have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. russia, u.k., china, saudi arabia, japan,
the failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. it is going so smoothly. also, i have spoken to many foreign leaders.
i am not trying to get \"top level security clearance\" for my children. this was a typically false news story.
very organized process taking place as i decide on cabinet and many other positions. i am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
the electoral college is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. campaigning is much different!
if the election were based on total popular vote i would have campaigned in  n.y. florida and california and won even bigger and more easily
the debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus our great supporters, gave us the win!
i will be interviewed on @60minutes tonight after the nfl game - 7:00 p.m. enjoy!
the @nytimes states today that djt believes \"more countries should acquire nuclear weapons.\" how dishonest are they. i never said this!
governor john kasich of the great, great, great state of ohio called to congratulate me on the win. the people of ohio were incredible!
jeb bush, george w and george h.w. all called to express their best wishes on the win. very nice!
mitt romney called to congratulate me on the win. very nice!
the @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their bad coverage of me. i wonder if it will change - doubt it?
wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the \"trump phenomena\"
this will prove to be a great time in the lives of all americans. we will unite and we will win, win, win!

crooked's state dept gave special attention to \"friends of bill\" after the haiti earthquake. unbelievable!http://abcn.ws/2d5mmzh 
i hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of hillary clinton as exposed by wikileaks. she is unfit to run.
in texas now, leaving soon for big rally in florida!
the very foul mouthed sen. john mccain begged for my support during his  primary (i gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks!
wow. unbelievable.https://twitter.com/tom_winter/status/785845815373856768 …
disloyal r's are far more difficult than crooked hillary. they come at you from all sides. they don’t know how to win - i will teach them!
with the exception of cheating bernie out of the nom the dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the republicans!
it is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and i can now fight for america the way i want to.
our very weak and ineffective leader, paul ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.
despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when paul ryan and others give zero support!
thank you pennsylvania. this is a movement like we have never seen before! #votetrumppence16 on 11/8/16- together, we will #maga!pic.twitter.com/vs64cuvczc

did crooked hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) alicia m become a u.s. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
using alicia m in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that crooked hillary suffers from bad judgement! hillary was set up by a con.
wow, crooked hillary was duped and used by my worst miss u. hillary floated her as an \"angel\" without checking her past, which is terrible!
anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying \"sources said,\" do not believe it. there are no sources, they are just made up lies!
wow, did you see how badly @cnn (clinton news network) is doing in the ratings. with people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?

russia took crimea during the so-called obama years. who wouldn't know this and why does obama get a free pass?
why isn't president obama working instead of campaigning for hillary clinton?

the seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
hillary clinton just had her 47% moment. what a terrible thing she said about so many great americans!
while hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, i still respect them all!
really sad that republicans would allow themselves to be used in a clinton ad. lindsey graham, romney, flake, sass. supreme court, remember!
wow, hillary clinton was so insulting to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. i think it will cost her at the polls!
will be in missouri today with melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, phyllis s!
\"@stvzbnk: just watched @tonyschwartz. obviously tony is a total whack job @realdonaldtrump\"
just returned from pensacola, florida, where the crowd was incredible.
i havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me. never liked his style. super lib, crooked h supporter. irrelevant dope!

jeff zucker failed @nbc and he is now failing @cnn.
.@cnn is unwatchable. their news on me is fiction. they\nare a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the clinton campaign.
the documentary of me that @cnn just aired is a total waste of time. i don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. a joke!

mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who i know is highly respected by president peña nieto.
hillary clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. she is totally confused. unfit to serve as #potus.
hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. she's being decimated by the media!

to the african-american community: the democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. i will fix it, vote \"t\"
the polls are close so crooked hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
the great state of arizona, where i just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective senator, jeff flake. sad!
the republican party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @jeffflake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
\"@annebellar: @realdonaldtrump @cnn cnn is so biased. never ever watch them. trump 2016!!\"
crooked hillary's v.p. pick said this morning that i was not aware that russia took over crimea. a total lie - and taken over during o term!
wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on crooked's fbi release. they are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
.@cnn is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting crooked hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

crooked hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by bernie s, she has bad judgement
does anyone know that crooked hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the bar exams in washington d.c. she was forced to go elsewhere

certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the u.s.supreme court get proper appointments. sad!
\"stay on message\" is the chant. i always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd a, repeal ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
i have always been the same person-remain true to self.the media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
it is not \"freedom of the press\" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
i am not only fighting crooked hillary, i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. people get it!
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media. she is not a talented person or politician. the dishonest media refuses to expose!
my rallies are not covered properly by the media. they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words i say, i would be beating hillary by 20%
the failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change. false, i am who i am-never said
the failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. their reporting is fiction. the media protects hillary!
\"@zulu_out: you are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #makeamericagreatagain #usa loves u\" thanks
\"@pauladuvall2: we're all enjoying you, as well, mr. t.! you've inspired hope and a positive spirit throughout america! god bless you!\" nice
\"@need2knowu:  @willspeakout yes you are my hero i admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for america!!!\"
we now have confirmation as to one reason crooked h wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - pay-for-play. how can she run for pres.
\"@willspeakout: thank you for all that you are doing for us! you campaign endlessly and have spent millions.we love you! #trumptrain\" thanks
i am truly enjoying myself while running for president. the people of our country are amazing - great numbers on november 8th!

i love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. they can't!
a massive tax increase will be necessary to fund crooked hillary clinton's agenda. what a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

people believe cnn these days almost as little as they believe hillary....that's really saying something!
the people who support hillary sit behind cnn anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
will cnn send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt hillary?
when will we see stories from cnn on clinton foundation corruption and hillary's pay-for-play at state department?
cnn anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
cnn will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for hillary clinton.

our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
hillary's refusal to mention radical islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complaining-then a small one. pathetic
our not very bright vice president, joe biden, just stated that i wanted to \"carpet bomb\" the enemy. sorry joe, that was ted cruz!
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. the danger is massive. no!
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. get tough!
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. no recognition - sad!
funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said \"trump is a genius.\" america 1st!
as i have been saying, crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
just like i have warned from the beginning, crooked hillary clinton will betray you on the tpp.http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/terry-mcauliffe-hillary-clinton-tpp-trade-226253 …
many of bernie's supporters have left the arena. did bernie go home and go to sleep?
i hate to say it, but the republican convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the democratic convention!
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. highly overrated!
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is, and neither does isis (a good thing). please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly
for the record, i have zero investments in russia.
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster, the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump. crazy!
dems don't want to talk isis b/c hillary's foreign interventions unleashed isis & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

pocahontas bombed last night! sad to watch.
why aren't the democrats speaking about isis, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. the republican convention was great
funny, if you listen to @foxnews, the democrats did not have a good day. if you listen to the other two, they are fawning. what a difference
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton. all of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! waste of time.
elizabeth warren, often referred to as pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary, who she always hated!
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution. we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party, they have no future! i know more about cory than he knows about himself.
i was at @foxnews and met juan williams in passing.  he asked if he could have pictures taken with me. i said fine. he then trashes on air!
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold. he got nothing for all of the time, energy and money. the v.p. a joke!
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
clinton betrayed bernie voters. kaine supports tpp, is in pocket of wall street, and backed iraq war.

great poll numbers are coming out all over. people don't want another four years of obama, and crooked hillary would be even worse. #maga
the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change!
wow, the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess. but fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
here we go again with another clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). crooked hillary knew the fix was in, b never had a chance!
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her \"servant\" was doing at the dnc - they just got caught, that's all! they laughed at bernie.
if bernie sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
thank you! #makeamericagreatagainpic.twitter.com/pzs9uwgzam
hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against bernie!
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because putin likes me
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on 60 minutes. no way they are going to fix america's problems. isis & all others laughing!
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. thank you!
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory, she's out!
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! e-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength, i don't believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook!
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, dws. too bad bernie flamed out
if the republican convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (bernie), media would go wild
the @cnn panels are so one sided, almost all against trump. @foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. don't watch cnn!
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated. the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
today proves what i have always known, that @reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not debbie wasserman shultz (@dwstweets.)
sorry folks, but bernie sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. he is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and dnc disrespect. sad!
there is no longer a bernie sanders \"political revolution.\" he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates.
looks like the bernie people will fight. if not, their blood, sweat and tears was a total waste of time. kaine stands for opposite!
wow, president obama's brother, malik, just announced that he is voting for me. was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
bernie sanders started off strong, but with the selection of kaine for v.p., is ending really weak. so much for a movement! total disrespect
the crooked hillary v.p. choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters. just another case of bad judgement by h!

thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night. from the heart!
the wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together. isis and our other enemies are drooling. they don't look presidential to me!
i will bring jobs back and get wages up. people haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. clinton killed jobs!
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. job killer!
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. i will bring jobs back!
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania. against steelworkers and miners. husband signed nafta.
leaked e-mails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders. mock his heritage and much more. on-line from wikileakes, really vicious. rigged
pocahontas wanted v.p. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the senate. also, crooked hillary hates her!
tim kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. bernie fought for nothing!
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine, who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for. philly fight?

is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didn't get indicted while bob m did?

the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melania's speech than the fbi spent on hillary's emails.
good news is melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
in november, i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state. jobs!
bill hemmer of @foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. more than in past years.
congratulations to my children, don and tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. i am very proud of you!

i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, as her v.p. then we can litigate her fraud!
it doesn't matter that crooked hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. bernie said she has bad judgement!

i made a lot of money in atlantic city and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.

crooked hillary clinton is unfit to serve as president of the u.s. her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. bad judgement!
i don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed crooked hillary to get away with \"murder.\" come november 8, she's out!
raised a lot of money for the republican party. there will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. lots of support! win
i will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @foxnews at 11pm. enjoy!
my son, @erictrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10pm on @foxnews. enjoy!
looking forward to meeting with @senbobcorker in a little while. we will be traveling to north carolina together today.
fbi director said crooked hillary compromised our national security. no charges. wow! #riggedsystem
the system is rigged. general petraeus got in trouble for far less. very very unfair! as usual, bad judgment.
it was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. she has done a fantastic job for the people of iowa and u.s. will see her again!
taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of air force one on the campaign trail by president obama and crooked hillary. a total disgrace!
on @foxnews at 7:00 p.m. \"special: meet the trumps\" hope you enjoy!
why is president obama allowed to use air force one on the campaign trail with crooked hillary? she is flying with him tomorrow. who pays?
with hillary and obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - radical islam!
crooked hillary clinton is \"guilty as hell\" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
the only people who are not interested in being the v.p. pick are the people who have not been asked!
i look forward to meeting @joniernst today in new jersey. she has done a great job as senator of iowa!
spent time with indiana governor mike pence and family yesterday. very impressed, great people!
senator tom cotton was great on meet the press yesterday. despite a totally one-sided interview by chuck todd, the end result was solid!
dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff's star, or plain star!
happy 4th of july! #trump2016 #americafirst https://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/videos/10157254332085725/ …pic.twitter.com/yhhyqjwjw6
crooked hillary will never be able to handle the complexities and danger of isis - it will just go on forever. we need change!
the third mass attack (slaughter) in days by isis. 200 dead in baghdad, worst in many years. we do not have leadership that can stop this!
in bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran. 20 were killed!
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the u.s.a.g. so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught!
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting \"go away, no pictures.\"
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. talked only about \"grandkids\" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
\"the system is rigged!\"
on saturday a great man, elie wiesel, passed away.the world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
crooked hillary clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the u.s.a.g. to work out a deal. the system is totally rigged & corrupt!
only a fool would believe that the meeting between bill clinton and the u.s.a.g. was not arranged or that crooked hillary did not know.
just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me chuck todd, and the entire show, is against me.the good news-the people get it!
it was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against crooked hillary clinton. like i said, the system is totally rigged!
it is impossible for the fbi not to recommend criminal charges against hillary clinton. what she did was wrong! what bill did was stupid!

take a look at what happened w/ bill clinton. the system is totally rigged. does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
bill clinton's meeting was a total secret. nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
as bernie sanders said, hillary clinton has bad judgement. bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by hillary!

the reason i put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, i want to make america great again!
i have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. i have totally terminated the loan!
the very dishonest @nbcnews refuses to accept the fact that i have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. done deal!
one of the reasons hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out america. \nhttp://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/u/us_clinton_emails?site=ap&section=home&template=default&ctime=2016-06-29-17-38-07 …

why would the uschamber be upset by the fact that i want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that i want penalties for cheaters?
the @uschamber must fight harder for the american worker. china, and many others, are taking advantage of u.s. with our terrible trade pacts
iron mike tyson was not asked to speak at the convention though i'm sure he would do a good job if he was. the media makes everything up!
\"@jtsbk:  @allenwest thanks for sharing eric we need @realdonaldtrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe\"
we must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the united states.
yet another terrorist attack, this time in turkey. will\nthe world ever realize what is going on? so sad.
hillary clinton’s presidency would be catastrophic for\nthe future of our country. she is ill-fit with bad judgment.
benghazi is just another hillary clinton failure. it just\nnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with clinton.

hillary clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo! she is spending a fortune, i am spending very little. close in polls!
people in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like crooked hillary will not win. it is time for change -- and jobs!

crooked hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at turnberry. shows me hitting shot, but i never did = lie! was there to support son
clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on brexit with big dollar ads. disgraceful!
crooked hillary clinton, who called brexit 100% wrong (along with obama), is now spending wall street money on an ad on my correct call.
george will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the republican party.he's made many bad calls
just landed in new york - a one night stay in scotland. turnberry came out magnificently. my son, eric, did a great job - under budget!
obama has blocked ice officers and bp from doing their jobs. that ends when i am president!
i have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land!
we only want to admit those who love our people and support our values. #americafirst

hillary clinton surged the trade deficit with china 40% as\nsecretary of state, costing americans millions of jobs.
hillary says this election is about judgment.  she's right.  her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed isis and wrecked the economy.

what has happened in orlando is just the beginning. our leadership is weak and ineffective. i called it and asked for the ban. must be tough
\"@wandawalls20: @realdonaldtrump please make us safe. we cannot have hillary as president. we will be in so much trouble.
reporting that orlando killer shouted \"allah hu akbar!\" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in la with rifles near gay parade.
is president obama going to finally mention the words radical islamic terrorism? if he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
appreciate the congrats for being right on radical islamic terrorism, i don't want congrats, i want toughness & vigilance. we must be smart!
horrific incident in fl. praying for all the victims & their families. when will this stop? when will we get tough, smart & vigilant?
clinton made a false ad about me where i was imitating a reporter groveling after he changed his story. i would never mock disabled. shame!
really bad shooting in orlando. police investigating possible terrorism. many people dead and wounded.
goofy elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, pretended to be a native american in order to advance her career. very racist!

obama just endorsed crooked hillary. he wants four more years of obama—but nobody else does!
crooked hillary clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else. obama plus!
as expected, the media is very much against me. their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win!
\"@kathyceurter: @realdonaldtrump please mr.trump make @senatorjeffsessions your vp. he is a perfect running mate.\"  he is a great guy!

i am getting bad marks from certain pundits because i have a small campaign staff. but small is good, flexible, save money and number one!
a massive blow to obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. that's really bad!
crooked hillary is being badly criticized (for a wall street paid for ad) by politifact for a false ad on me on women. she is a total fraud!
crooked hillary clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
just like i have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. we can be great!
people like @katyturnbc report on my campaign, but have zero access. they say what they want without any knowledge.true of so much of media!
hillary clinton is unfit to be president. she has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. change!
i am watching @cnn very little lately because they are so biased against me. shows are predictable garbage! cnn and msm is one big lie!
the clinton news network, sometimes referred to as @cnn, is getting more and more biased.they act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

crooked hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. people will not allow another four years of incompetence!

after the litigation is disposed of and the case won, i have instructed my execs to open trump u(?), so much interest in it! i will be pres.
even though i have a very biased and unfair judge in the trump u civil case in san diego, i have thousands of great reviews & will win case!

i have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great veterans, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. watch!
so many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! news conference at 11:00 a.m. today, trump tower!
i should have easily won the trump university case on summary judgement but have a judge, gonzalo curiel, who is totally biased against me.
i have a judge in the trump university civil case, gonzalo curiel (san diego), who is very unfair. an obama pick. totally biased-hates trump

in getting the endorsement of the 16,500 border patrol agents (thank you), the statement was made that the wall was very necessary!

does president obama ever discuss the sneak attack on pearl harbor while he's in japan? thousands of american lives lost. #mdw
don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. the only quote that matters is a quote from me!
i am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when i won the gop nomination, i'm in the back of the paper. very dishonest!
the media is on a new phony kick about my management style. i spend much less money & get much better results! what we need as prez!

crooked hillary wants a radical 500% increase in syrian refugees. we can’t allow this. time to get smart and protect america!
how can crooked hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical islam, which horribly oppresses women?
why do the networks continue to put dopey @billkristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs?
hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! would be four more years of stupidity!
crooked hillary said that i  want guns brought into the school classroom. wrong!
\"@dubilujane: i trust @realdonaldtrump more anyone ever to protect america.he will do the right thing for the u.s.a, without a  doubt.

\"@rbacliff: hillary wants to rip the guns out of america's hands. no guns = no protection. get on #trumptrain & join @nra to stop her.\"
crooked hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. no more guns to protect hillary!
while our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the tsa is falling apart, just like our government! airports a total disaster!
crooked hillary is spending tremendous amounts of wall street money on false ads against me. she is a very dishonest person!
crooked hillary clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. no gun owner can ever vote for clinton!
thank you @thetodaysgolfer for the wonderful statement that \"the new par 3 9th hole @trump turnberry could be the most dramatic in britain.\"

crooked hillary can't even close the deal with bernie - and the dems have it rigged in favor of hillary. four more years of this? no way!
crooked hillary clinton looks presidential? i don't think so! four more years of obama and our country will never come back. isis laughs!
look where the world is today, a total mess, and isis is still running around wild. i can fix it fast, hillary has no chance!
crooked hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. isis, china, russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
i said that crooked hillary clinton is \"not qualified\" to be president because she has \"very bad judgement\" - bernie said the same thing!

amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in u.s. political history
oregon is voting today. keep the big numbers going - vote trump! make america great again!
crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women. can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! my hit was on china
the pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. \"you can tell them to go blank themselves\" - was about china, not women!
wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton. she said they had to do with a wedding reception. liar! how can she run?

the writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, michael barbaro, who was interviewed on cbs this morning, was unable to respond.
over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. that’s because there were so many positive statements.
no wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me.
the failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.

i will be campaigning in indiana all day. things are looking great, and the support of bobby knight has been so amazing. today will be fun!
everybody is talking about the protesters burning the american flags and proudly waving mexican flags. i want america first - so do voters!
gov mike pence has just stated that donald trump has taken a strong stance on hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! i will bring back jobs to usa.
crooked hillary clinton said she is used to \"dealing with men who get off the reservation.\" actually, she has done poorly with such men!
