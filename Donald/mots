Certain

rather
save

by

me
than

is
the
chant
I
always
do

A
repeal
Ocare
borders

but

misrepresents
-
I
have
always
been
the
same
person
remain
true
to
self
The
media
wants
me
to
change
but
it
would
be
very
dishonest
to
supporters
to
do
so
-
It
is
not
freedom
of
the
press
when

others
are
allowed
to
say
and
write
whatever
they
want
even
if
it

false

I
am
not
only
fighting
Crooked
Hillary
I
am
fighting
the
dishonest
and
corrupt
media
and
her
government
protection
process
People
get
it
-
Crooked
Hillary
Clinton
is
being
protected
by
the
media
She
is
not
a
talented
person
or
politician
The
dishonest
media
refuses
to
expose
-
My
rallies
are
not
covered
properly
by
the
media
They
never
discuss
the
real
message
and
never
show
crowd
size
or
enthusiasm
-
If
the
disgusting
and
corrupt
media
covered
me
honestly
and
didn
t
put
false
meaning
into
the
words
I
say
I
would
be
beating
Hillary
by
20%
-
The
failing
@
which
never
spoke
to
me
keeps
saying
that
I
am
saying
to
advisers
that
I
will
change
False
I

I

so
bad

that
it

it

STATEMENT
ON

The

more
publicity

any

Crooked
Hillary

once

proven
to
be
a
person
who
is
dishonest
incompetent

of
very
bad
judgement
-
Crooked

her

extremely
careless

Crooked

Clinton

Done

One
of
the
reasons
Hillary

so

how

out

The
State
of
Iowa
should
disqualify
Ted
Cruz
from
the
most
recent
election
on
the
basis
that
he
cheated
a
total

out

Ted

Iowans
arrived

Based
on
the
fraud
committed
by
Senator
Ted
Cruz
during
the
Iowa
Caucus
either
a
new
election
should
take
place
or
Cruz
results
nullified
-
And
finally
Cruz
strongly
told
thousands
of
caucusgoers
voters
that
Trump
was
strongly
in
favor
of
ObamaCare
and
choice
a
total
lie
-
Many
people
voted
for
Cruz
over
Carson
because
of
this
Cruz
fraud
Also
Cruz
sent
out
a
VOTER
VIOLATION
certificate
to
thousands
of
voters
-
During
primetime
of
the
Iowa
Caucus
Cruz
put
out
a
release
that
@
was
quitting
the
race
and
to
caucus
or
vote
for
Cruz
-
Ted
Cruz
didn
t
win
Iowa
he
stole
it
That

why
all

wrong

why
he

my

the

A
terrible
deal
with
Iran
*
-
When
I
intelligently
turned
down
The
Club
For
Growth
crazy
request
for
$1
000
000
they
got
nasty
What
a
waste
of
money
that
would
have
been
-
The
president
of
the
pathetic
Club
For
Growth
came
to
my
office
in
N
Y
C
and
asked
for
a
ridiculous
$1
000
000
contribution
I
said
no
way
-
Every
Poll
has
me
winning
BIG
If
you
listen
to
dopey
Karl
Rove
a
Trump
hater
on
@
you
would
think
I
m
doing
poorly
@
-
Why
does
@
and
@
always
have
Karl
Rove
on
He
spent
$430
million
and
lost
ALL
races
A
dope
who
said
Romney
won
election
-
I
m
turning
down
millions
of
dollars
of
campaign
contributions
îfeel
totally
stupid
doing
so
but
hope
it
is
appreciated
by
the
voters
-
Many
Super
Pacs
funded
by
groups
that
want
total
control
over
their
candidate
are
being
formed
to
attack
Trump
Remember
when

them

No
more
Clintons
or
Bushes

Congrats
everyone
we
topped
4
million
today
on

While
millions
are
being
spent
against
me
in
attack
ads
they
are
paid
for
by
the
bosses
and
owners
of
candidates
I

self

-
Jeb
is
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
hit
ads
funded
by
lobbyists
&
special

Bad
system
-
Yet
another
weak
hit
by
a
candidate
with
a
failing
campaign
Will
Jeb
sink
as
low
in
the
polls
as
the
others
who
have
gone
after
me

@

Too

John
