no

the
threat
from
radical
islamic
terrorism
is
very
real
just
look
at
what
is
happening
in
europe
and
the
middle
east
courts
must
act
fast
the
failing
was
forced
to
apologize
to
its
subscribers
for
the
poor
reporting
it
did
on
my
election
win
now
they
are
worse
an
extended
interview
from
the
super
bowl
with
airs
tonight
at
p.m
enjoy
 failing
writes
total
fiction
concerning
me
they
have
gotten
it
wrong
for
two
years
and
now
are
making
up
stories
sources
i
call
my
own
shots
largely
based
on
an
accumulation
of
data
and
everyone
knows
it
some
fake
news
media
in
order
to
marginalize
lies
any
negative
polls
are
fake
news
just
like
the
cnn
abc
nbc
polls
in
the
election
sorry
people
want
border
security
and
extreme
vetting
what
an
amazing
comeback
and
win
by
the
patriots
tom
brady
bob
kraft
and
coach
b
are
total
winners
wow
enjoy
the
pand
then
we
continue
make
america
great
again
i
have
instructed
homeland
security
to
check
people
coming
into
our
country
very
carefully
the
courts
are
making
the
job
very
difficult
just
cannot
believe
a
judge
would
put
our
country
in
such
peril
if
something
happens
blame
him
and
court
system
people
pouring
in
bad
the
judge
opens
up
our
country
to
potential
terrorists
and
others
that
do
not
have
our
best
interests
at
heart
bad
people
are
very
happy
interview
with
on
fox
network
p.m
prior
to
super
bowl
enjoy
why
aren't
the
lawyers
looking
at
and
using
the
federal
court
decision
in
boston
which
is
at
conflict
with
ridiculous
lift
ban
decision
because
the
ban
was
lifted
by
a
judge
many
very
bad
and
dangerous
people
may
be
pouring
into
our
country
a
terrible
decision
what
is
our
country
coming
to
when
a
judge
can
halt
a
homeland
security
travel
ban
and
anyone
even
with
bad
intentions
can
come
into
u
s
make
america
great
again
after
being
forced
to
apologize
for
its
bad
and
inaccurate
coverage
of
me
after
winning
the
election
the
fake
news
is
still
lost
the
opinion
of
this
so
called
judge
which
essentially
takes
law
enforcement
away
from
our
country
is
ridiculous
and
will
be
overturned
interesting
that
certain
middle
eastern
countries
agree
with
the
ban
they
know
if
certain
people
are
allowed
in
it's
death
destruction
when
a
country
is
no
longer
able
to
say
who
can
and
who
cannot
come
in
out
especially
for
reasons
of
safety
security
big
trouble
countries
charge
u
s
companies
taxes
or
tariffs
while
the
u
s
charges
them
nothing
or
little
we
should
charge
them
same
as
they
charge
us
we
must
keep
evil
out

upset
angry
for
many
years
our
country
has
been
divided
angry
and
untrusting
many
say
it
will
never
change
the
hatred
is
too
deep.

living
in
nazi
germany

when
he
totally
changed
a
year
old
story
that
he
had
written
in
order
to
make
me
look
bad
just
more
very
dishonest
media
hillary
flunky

lost
big
for
the
th
time

never

who
likes
me
much
better

very
successful

than
he
ever
did

a
very
successful
developer
dishonest
media
says
mexico
won't
be
paying
for
the
wall
if
they
pay
a
little
later
so
the
wall
can
be
built
more
quickly

is
fake
before

highly
confidential

very
special
congratulation
to
jane

on
her
major
upset
victory
in
becoming
the
ohio
republican
party
chair
jane
is
a
loyal
trump
supporter
star
both
countries
will
perhaps
work
together
to
solve
some
of
the
many
great
and
pressing
problems
and
issues
of
the
world
have
enough
problems
around
the
world
without
yet
another
one
when
i
am
president
russia
will
respect
us
far
more
than
they
do
now
and
having
a
good
relationship
with
russia
is
a
good
thing
not
a
bad
thing
only
stupid
people
or
fools
would
think
that
it
is
bad
we
only
reason
the
hacking
of
the
poorly
defended
dnc
is
discussed
is
that
the
loss
by
the
dems
was
so
big
that
they
are
totally
embarrassed
intelligence
stated
very
strongly
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
that
hacking
affected
the
election
results
voting
machines
not
touched
gross
negligence
by
the
democratic
national
committee
allowed
hacking
to
take
place
the
republican
national
committee
had
strong
defense
happy
birthday
pn the
terrible
situation
in
florida
just
spoke
to
governor
scott
thoughts
and
prayers
for
all
stay
safe
i
am
asking
the
chairs
of
the
house
and
senate
committees
to
investigate
top
secret
intelligence
shared
with
nbc
prior
to
me
seeing
it
anna
wintour
came
to
my
office
at
trump
tower
to
ask
me
to
meet
with
the
editors
of
conde
nast
steven
newhouse
a
friend
will
go
this
am
being
a
movie
star
and
that
was
season
compared
to
season
now
compare
him
to
my
season
but
who
cares
he
supported
kasich
hillary
wow
the
ratings
are
in
and
arnold
schwarzenegger
got
swamped
or
destroyed
by
comparison
to
the
ratings
machine
djt
so
much
for
hopefully
all
supporters
and
those
who
want
to
make
america
great
again
will
go
to
d
c
on
january
th.
it
will
be
a
great
show
and
knew
they
were
in
big
trouble
which
is
why
they
cancelled
their
big
fireworks
at
the
last
minute
they
saw
a
movement
like
never
before
hillary
and
the
dems
were
never
going
to
beat
the
passion
of
my
voters
they
saw
what
was
happening
in
the
last
two
weeks
before
the
the
dishonest
media
does
not
report
that
any
money
spent
on
building
the
great
wall
for
sake
of
speed
will
be
paid
back
by
mexico
later
so
how
and
why
are
they
so
sure
about
hacking
if
they
never
even
requested
an
examination
of
the
computer
servers
what
is
going
on
the
democratic
national
committee
would
not
allow
the
fbi
to
study
or
see
its
computer
info
after
it
was
supposedly
hacked
by
russia
how
did
nbc
get
an
exclusive
look
into
the
top
secret
report
he
obama
was
presented
who
gave
them
this
report
and
why
politics
toyota
motor
said
will
build
a
new
plant
in
baja
mexico
to
build
corolla
cars
for
u
s
no
way
build
plant
in
u
s
or
pay
big
border
tax
to
make
up
their
own
minds
as
to
the
truth.
the
media
lies
to
make
it
look
like
i
am
against
intelligence
when
in
fact
i
am
a
big
fan
the
dishonest
media
likes
saying
that
i
am
in
agreement
with
julian
assange
wrong
i
simply
state
what
he
states
it
is
for
the
people
time
for
republicans
democrats
to
get
together
and
come
up
with
a
healthcare
plan
that
really
works
much
less
expensive
far
better
do
the
typical
political
thing
and
blame
the
fact
is
obamacare
was
a
lie
from
the
beginning
keep
you
doctor
keep
your
plan
it
is
the
democrats
lead
by
head
clown
chuck
schumer
know
how
bad
obamacare
is
and
what
a
mess
they
are
in
instead
of
working
to
fix
it
they
jackie
evancho's
album
sales
have
skyrocketed
after
announcing
her
inauguration
performance
some
people
just
don't
understand
the
movement
massive
increases
of
obamacare
will
take
place
this
year
and
dems
are
to
blame
for
the
mess
it
will
fall
of
its
own
weight
be
careful
like
the
hike
in
arizona
also
deductibles
are
so
high
that
it
is
practically
useless
don't
let
the
schumer
clowns
out
of
this
web
republicans
must
be
careful
in
that
the
dems
own
the
failed
obamacare
disaster
with
its
poor
coverage
and
massive
premium
increases
things
they
did
and
said
like
giving
the
questions
to
the
debate
to
h)
a
total
double
standard
media
as
usual
gave
them
a
pass
somebody
hacked

why
did
they
not
have
hacking
defense
like
the

has
and
why
have
they
not
responded
to

terrible

you

scrapping
a
new

in
mexico
and
creating
new

in

this
is
just
the
beginning
much
more
to
follow
julian

very
dishonest

more
dishonest
than
anyone

sad

vladimir

said
today
about

in
my
opinion
it
is
humiliating
one
must
be
able
to
lose
with
dignity
so
true
slaughter
you
this
is
a
purely
religious
threat
which
turned
into

such
hatred
when

my

someone
incorrectly
stated

the

actually
we

discussing
the
fact
that
i
spent

less
money
on

than
hillary
on
the
loss
i
would
have
done
even
better
in
the
election
if
that
is
possible
if
the
winner
was
based
on
popular
vote
but
would
campaign
differently
campaigning
to
win
the

is
much
more
difficult
sophisticated
than
the
popular

hillary

n thoughts
and
prayers
are
with
the
great
people
of
tennessee
during
these
terrible
wildfires
stay
safe
nobody
should
be
allowed
to
burn
the
american
flag
if
they
do
there
must
be
consequences
perhaps
loss
of
citizenship
or
year
in
jail
i
thought
that
would
get
better
after
they
failed
so
badly
in
their
support
of
hillary
clinton
however
since
election
they
are
worse
the
great
state
of
michigan
was
just
certified
as
a
trump
win
giving
all
of
our
make
america
great
again
supporters
another
victory
is
so
embarrassed
by
their
total
support
of
hillary
clinton
and
yet
her
loss
in
a
landslide
that
they
don't
know
what
to
do
hhhthere
is
no
question
that
did
take
place
and
in
favor
of
phpathetic
you
have
no
sufficient
evidence
that
donald
trump
did
not
suffer
from
voter
fraud
shame
bad
reporter
just
another
generic
cnn
part
time
wannabe
journalist
still
doesn't
get
it
they
will
never
learn
hhhwhat
proof
do
u
have
donaldtrump
did
not
suffer
from
millions
of
fraud
votes
journalist
do
your
job
just
met
with
general
petraeus
was
very
impressed
if
cuba
is
unwilling
to
make
a
better
deal
for
the
cuban
people
the
cuban
american
people
and
the
u
s
as
a
whole
i
will
terminate
deal
serious
voter
fraud
in
virginia
new
hampshire
and
california
so
why
isn't
the
media
reporting
on
this
serious
bias
big
problem
states
instead
of
the
states
that
i
visited
i
would
have
won
even
more
easily
and
convincingly
but
smaller
states
are
forgotten
it
would
have
been
much
easier
for
me
to
win
the
so
called
popular
vote
than
the
electoral
college
in
that
i
would
only
campaign
in
or
in
addition
to
winning
the
electoral
college
in
a
landslide
i
won
the
popular
vote
if
you
deduct
the
millions
of
people
who
voted
illegally
trump
is
going
to
be
our
president
we
owe
him
an
open
mind
and
the
chance
to
lead
so
much
time
and
money
will
be
spent
same
result
sad
this
election
that
is
a
direct
threat
to
our
democracy
she
then
said
we
have
to
accept
the
results
and
look
to
the
future
donald
of
position
then
separately
she
stated
he
said
something
truly
horrifying
he
refused
to
say
that
he
would
respect
the
results
of
during
a
general
election
i
for
one
am
appalled
that
somebody
that
is
the
nominee
of
one
of
our
two
major
parties
would
take
that
kind
and
fair
elections
we've
accepted
the
outcomes
when
we
may
not
have
liked
them
and
that
is
what
must
be
expected
of
anyone
standing
on
a
hillary's
debate
answer
on
delay
that
is
horrifying
that
is
not
the
way
our
democracy
works
been
around
for
years
we've
had
free
hillary
clinton
conceded
the
election
when
she
called
me
just
prior
to
the
victory
speech
and
after
the
results
were
in
nothing
will
change
the
democrats
when
they
incorrectly
thought
they
were
going
to
win
asked
that
the
election
night
tabulation
be
accepted
not
so
anymore
the
green
party
scam
to
fill
up
their
coffers
by
asking
for
impossible
recounts
is
now
being
joined
by
the
badly
defeated
demoralized
dems
fidel
castro
is
dead
i
am
working
hard
even
on
thanksgiving
trying
to
get
carrier
a
c
company
to
stay
in
the
u
s
indiana
making
progress
will
know
soon
happy
thanksgiving
to
everyone
we
will
together
make
america
great
again
let
us
give
thanks
for
all
that
we
have
and
let
us
boldly
face
the
exciting
new
frontiers
that
lie
ahead
happy
thanksgiving
 crash
in
tennessee
so
sad
so
terrible
condolences
to
all
family
members
and
loved
ones
these
beautiful
children
will
be
remembered
i
am
seriously
considering
dr
ben
carson
as
the
head
of
hud
i've
gotten
to
know
him
well
he's
a
greatly
talented
person
who
loves
people
the
meeting
with
the
is
back
on
at
today
look
forward
to
it

take
place
today
at
trump
tower
concerning
the
formation
of
the
people
who
will
run
our
government
for
the
next
years
the
failing
just
announced
that
complaints
about
them
are
at
a
year
high.
i
can
fully
understand
that
but
why
announce
perhaps
a
new
meeting
will
be
set
up
with
the
in
the
meantime
they
continue
to
cover
me
inaccurately
and
with
a
nasty
tone
i
cancelled
today's
meeting
with
the
failing
when
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
meeting
were
changed
at
the
last
moment
not
nice
many
people
would
like
to
see
represent
great
britain
as
their
ambassador
to
the
united
states
he
would
do
a
great
job
prior
to
the
election
it
was
well
known
that
i
have
interests
in
properties
all
over
the
world
only
the
crooked
media
makes
this
a
big
deal
update
and
policy
plans
for
the
first
days
 have
always
had
a
good
relationship
with
chuck
schumer
he
is
far
smarter
than
harry
r
and
has
the
ability
to
get
things
done
good
news
general
james
mad
dog
mattis
who
is
being
considered
for
secretary
of
defense
was
very
impressive
yesterday
a
true
general's
general
i
watched
parts
of
saturday
night
live
last
night.
it
is
a
totally
one
sided
biased
show
nothing
funny
at
all
equal
time
for
us
numerous
patriots
will
be
coming
to
bedminster
today
as
i
continue
to
fill
out
the
various
positions
necessary
to
make
america
great
again
the
cast
and
producers
of
hamilton
which
i
hear
is
highly
overrated
should
immediately
apologize
to
mike
pence
for
their
terrible
behavior
the
theater
must
always
be
a
safe
and
special
place
the
cast
of
hamilton
was
very
rude
last
night
to
a
very
good
man
mike
pence
apologize
our
wonderful
future
v
p.
mike
pence
was
harassed
last
night
at
the
theater
by
the
cast
of
hamilton
cameras
blazing
this
should
not
happen
the
only
bad
thing
about
winning
the
presidency
is
that
i
did
not
have
the
time
to
go
through
a
long
but
winning
trial
on
trump
u
too
bad
i
settled
the
trump
university
lawsuit
for
a
small
fraction
of
the
potential
award
because
as
president
i
have
to
focus
on
our
country
will
be
working
all
weekend
in
choosing
the
great
men
and
women
who
will
be
helping
to
make
america
great
again
i
worked
hard
with
bill
ford
to
keep
the
lincoln
plant
in
kentucky
i
owed
it
to
the
great
state
of
kentucky
for
their
confidence
in
me
just
got
a
call
from
my
friend
bill
ford
chairman
of
ford
who
advised
me
that
he
will
be
keeping
the
lincoln
plant
in
kentucky
no
mexico
my
transition
team
which
is
working
long
hours
and
doing
a
fantastic
job
will
be
seeing
many
great
candidates
today
australia
new
zealand
and
more
i
am
always
available
to
them
is
just
upset
that
they
looked
like
fools
in
their
coverage
of
me
i
have
recieved
and
taken
calls
from
many
foreign
leaders
despite
what
the
failing
said
russia
u
k
china
saudi
arabia
japan
the
failing
story
is
so
totally
wrong
on
transition
it
is
going
so
smoothly
also
i
have
spoken
to
many
foreign
leaders
i
am
not
trying
to
get
top
level
security
clearance
for
my
children
this
was
a
typically
false
news
story
very
organized
process
taking
place
as
i
decide
on
cabinet
and
many
other
positions
i
am
the
only
one
who
knows
who
the
finalists
are
the
electoral
college
is
actually
genius
in
that
it
brings
all
states
including
the
smaller
ones
into
play
campaigning
is
much
different
if
the
election
were
based
on
total
popular
vote
i
would
have
campaigned
in
n
y
florida
and
california
and
won
even
bigger
and
more
easily
the
debates
especially
the
second
and
third
plus
speeches
and
intensity
of
the
large
rallies
plus
our
great
supporters
gave
us
the
win
i
will
be
interviewed
on
tonight
after
the
nfl
game
p.m
enjoy
the
states
today
that
djt
believes
more
countries

said
this
governor
john
kasich

the
great
great

state
of
ohio

me

bad
coverage

wonder
if
it
will
change

it
wow
the

losing
thousands
of
subscribers
because
of
their
very
poor
and
highly
inaccurate
coverage
of

this
will
prove
to
be
a
great
time
in
the
lives
of
all
americans
we
will
unite
and
we
will
win

it
would
be

it

not
freedom

they

are
not
covered
properly
by

they
never
discuss
the
real
message
and
never
show

size
or
enthusiasm
if
the
disgusting
and
corrupt

covered
me
honestly
and
didn't
put
false
meaning
into
the

i
would
be

false
i

was

more
interesting
with

no

time
elizabeth
warren
often
referred
to
as
pocahontas
just
misrepresented
me
and
spoke
glowingly
about
crooked
hillary
who
she
always
hated
sad
to
watch
bernie
sanders
abandon
his
revolution
we
welcome
all
voters
who
want
to
fix
our
rigged
system
and
bring
back
our
jobs
if
cory
booker
is
the
future
of
the
democratic
party
they
have
no
future
i
know
more
about
cory
than
he
knows
about
himself
i
was
at
and
met
juan
williams
in
passing
he
asked
if
he
could
have
pictures
taken
with
me
i
said
fine
he
then
trashes
on
air
hard
to
believe
that
bernie
sanders
has
done
such
a
complete
fold
he
got
nothing
for
all
of
the
time
energy
and
money
the
v
p.
a
joke
while
bernie
has
totally
given
up
on
his
fight
for
the
people
we
welcome
all
voters
who
want
a
better
future
for
our
workers

pn 
n poll
numbers
are
coming
out
all
over
people
don't
want
another
four
years
of
obama
and
crooked
hillary
would
be
even
worse
the
state
of
florida
is
so
embarrassed
by
the
antics
of
crooked
hillary
clinton
and
debbie
wasserman
schultz
that
they
will
vote
for
change
wow
the
republican
convention
went
so
smoothly
compared
to
the
dems
total
mess
but
fear
not
the
dishonest
media
will
find
a
good
spinnnn
here
we
go
again
with
another
clinton
scandal
and
e
mails
yet
can
you
believe
crooked
hillary
knew
the
fix
was
in
b
never
had
a
chance
crooked
hillary
clinton
knew
everything
that
her
servant
was
doing
at
the
dnc
they
just
got
caught,
that's
all
they
laughed
at
bernie
if
bernie
sanders
after
seeing
the
just
released
e
mails
continues
to
look
exhausted
and
done
then
his
legacy
will
never
be
the
same
thank
you
involved
in
the
e
mail
scandal
because
she
is
the
only
one
with
judgement
so
bad
that
such
a
thing
could
have
happened
how
much
bad
judgement
was
on
display
by
the
people
in
dnc
in
writing
those
really
dumb
e
mails
using
even
religion
against
bernie
the
new
joke
in
town
is
that
russia
leaked
the
disastrous
dnc
e
mails
which
should
never
have
been
written
stupid
because
putin
likes
me
watched
crooked
hillary
clinton
and
tim
kaine
on
minutes
no
way
they
are
going
to
fix
america's
problems
isis
all
others
laughing
the
ratings
for
the
republican
national
convention
were
very
good
but
for
the
final
night,
my
speech,
great
thank
you
the
highly
neurotic
debbie
wasserman
schultz
is
angry
that
after
stealing
and
cheating
her
way
to
a
crooked
hillary
victory
she's
out
the
democrats
are
in
a
total
meltdown
but
the
biased
media
will
say
how
great
they
are
doing
e
mails
say
the
rigged
system
is
alive
well
even
though
bernie
sanders
has
lost
his
energy
and
his
strength,
i
don't
believe
that
his
supporters
will
let
crooked
hillary
off
the
hook
crooked
hillary
clinton
was
not
at
all
loyal
to
the
person
in
her
rigged
system
that
pushed
her
over
the
top,
dws
too
bad
bernie
flamed
out
if
the
republican
convention
had
blown
up
with
e
mails
resignation
of
boss
and
the
beat
down
of
a
big
player
bernie
media
would
go
wild
the
panels
are
so
one
sided
almost
all
against
trump.
is
so
much
better
and
the
ratings
are
much
higher
don't
watch
cnn
i
always
said
that
debbie
wasserman
schultz
was
overrated
the
dems
convention
is
cracking
up
and
bernie
is
exhausted
no
energy
left
today
proves
what
i
have
always
known
that
priebus
is
the
tough
one
and
the
smart
one
not
debbie
wasserman
shultz
sorry
folks
but
bernie
sanders
is
exhausted
just
can't
go
on
any
longer
he
is
trying
to
dismiss
the
new
e
mails
and
dnc
disrespect
sad
there
is
no
longer
a
bernie
sanders
political
revolution
he
is
turning
out
to
be
a
weak
and
somewhat
pathetic
figure
wants
it
all
to
end
an
analysis
showed
that
bernie
sanders
would
have
won
the
democratic
nomination
if
it
were
not
for
the
super
delegates
looks
like
the
bernie
people
will
fight.
if
not
their
blood
sweat
and
tears
was
a
total
waste
of
time
kaine
stands
for
opposite
wow
president
obama's
brother
malik
just
announced
that
he
is
voting
for
me
was
probably
treated
badly
by
president
like
everybody
else
bernie
sanders
started
off
strong
but
with
the
selection
of
kaine
for
v
p.
is
ending
really
weak
so
much
for
a
movement
total
disrespect
the
crooked
hillary
v
p.
choice
is
very
disrespectful
to
bernie
sanders
and
all
of
his
supporters
just
another
case

bad

of
my
speech
on
thursday
night.
from
the
heart
the
wikileaks
e
mail
release
today
was
so
bad
to
sanders
that
it
will
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
support
her
unless
he
is
a
fraud
just
saw
crooked
hillary
and
tim

together

bring

more
on
line
from
wikileakes
really
vicious
rigged
pocahontas
wanted

so
badly
but
wasn't
chosen
because
she
has
done
nothing

also
crooked

and
always
has
been
owned

outraged

their
last
choice

fought
for
nothing
the
bernie
sanders
supporters
are
furious
with
the
choice
of
tim

who
represents
the
opposite
of
what

stands
for

i
made

be
a
person
who
is
dishonest
incompetent
and
of
very
bad
judgement
crooked
hillary
clinton
and
her
team
were
extremely
careless
in
their
handling
of
very
sensitive
highly
classified
information
not
fit
crooked
hillary
clinton
is
unfit
to
serve
as
president
of
the

s
her
temperament
is
weak
and
her
opponents
are
strong
bad
judgement
i
don't
think
the

forget
the
rigged
system
that
allowed
crooked
hillary
to
get
away
with
murder
come
november
she's
out
raised
a
lot
of
money
for
the

solid
dishonest
media

trying
their
absolute
best
to
depict
a

star
or

was
just
a
coincidence
bill
clinton's
meeting
was
a
total
secret
nobody
was
to
know
about
it
but
he
was
caught
by
a
local
reporter
as
bernie
sanders
said
hillary
clinton

bad
judgement
bill's
meeting
was
probably
initiated

again
i
have
self
funded
my
winning
primary
campaign
with
an
approx
million
loan
i

loan
the
very
dishonest
refuses
to
accept
the
fact
that
i
have
forgiven
my
million
loan
to
my
campaign
done
deal
one
of
the
reasons
hillary
hid
her
emails
was
so
the
public
wouldn't
see
how
she
got
rich-
selling
out
america
n would
college
graduates
want
crooked
hillary
as
their
president
she
will
destroy
them
 book
by
is
absolutely
terrific
and
a
must
read
pthe
story
with
hillary
will
never
change
 reasons
only
they
can
explain
the
hwants
to
continue
our
bad
trade
deals

than
renegotiating

rich!
corrupt
dangerous
dishonest
if

murder
gays
i

surged
the

deficit
with
china
as
nsecretary
of

millions
of

unleashed
isis
and
wrecked
the

held
a

more
than
months
her
record
is
so
bad
she
is
unable
to
answer
tough
questions
just
like
i
have
been
able
to
spend
far
less
money
than
others
on
the
campaign
and
finish
so
too
should
our
country
we
can
be
great
people
like
report
on
my
campaign
but
have
zero
access
they
say
what
they
want
without
any
knowledge
true
of
so
much
of
media
hillary
clinton
is
unfit
to
be
president
she
has
bad
judgement
poor
leadership
skills
and
a
very
bad
and
destructive
track
record
change
i
am
watching
very
little
lately
because
they
are
so
biased
against
me
shows

predictable
garbage
cnn

one
big
lie
the

network
sometimes
referred
to

many
of

the
endorsement
of
me
by

border
patrol
agents
was
the
first
time
that
they
ever
endorsed
a

nice
in
getting
the
endorsement
of
the
border
patrol
agents
thank
you
the
statement
was
made
that
the
wall
was
very
necessary
obama
says
a
wall
at
our
southern
border
won't
enhance
our
security
wrong
and
yet
he
now
wants
to
build
a
much
bigger
wall
fence
at
w
h.
if
dummy
bill
kristol
actually
does
get
a
spoiler
to
run
as
an
independent
say
good
bye
to
the
supreme
court
the
republican
party
has
to
be
smart
strong
if
it
wants
to
win
in
november
can't
allow
lightweights
to
set
up
a
spoiler
indie
candidate
bill
kristol
has
been
wrong
for
yrs
an
embarrassed
loser
but
if
the
gop
can't
control
their
own
then
they
are
not
a
party
be
tough,
r's
good
news
is
that
my
campaign
has
perhaps
more
cash
than
any
campaign
in
the
history
of
politics
b
c
i
stand
behind
everything
we
do
heading
to

does

ever
discuss
the
sneak
attack
on

harbor
while
he's

lives
lost
don't
believe
the

the
writer
of
the
now

and
her
phony
native
american
heritage
are
on

rant
she
is

me
just
met
with
courageous

sarah
was
horribly
killed
by

immigrant
but
leaves
behind
amazing
legacy
goofy
elizabeth
warren
hillary
clinton
s
flunky
has
a
career
that
is
totally
based
on
a
lie
she
is
not
native

let
s
properly
check
goofy
elizabeth
warren
s
records
to
see
if
she
is
native
american
i
say
she
s
a
fraud
i
hope
corrupt
hillary
clinton
chooses
goofy
elizabeth
warren
as
her
running
mate
i
will
defeat
them
both.
